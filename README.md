## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/books-library.git
cd books-library
````

2. Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

3. Install backend dependencies:

```bash
cd ../server
npm install
```

4. Start development servers:

* Backend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

* Frontend:

```bash
cd ../client
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run at `http://localhost:5173` and the backend at `http://localhost:5555` (or as configured).

---

## Production Build

Create an optimized frontend build:

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

Serve backend and frontend together in production using your preferred method (e.g., **Vercel + Render**, **Heroku**, or **Netlify**).

---

## Backend API

The app requires a backend API for book data. Example endpoint:

```
GET http://localhost:5555/books
```

Example JSON response:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "_id": "1",
      "title": "Book Title",
      "author": "Author Name",
      "publishYear": 2023
    }
  ]
}
```

> Replace the API URL with the deployed backend URL for production.

---

## Deployment

Recommended deployment platforms:

* **Frontend:** Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages
* **Backend:** Render, Railway, Heroku

**Tip:** Ensure the backend API URL is updated in the frontend for live deployment.

---

## Recommended Vite Plugins

* `@vitejs/plugin-react` – Babel-based Fast Refresh
* `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` – SWC-based Fast Refresh for faster builds
